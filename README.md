# crop-prediction
 i Done a crop prediction Machine Learning project
#  The first  step Data cleaning And preprocessing
   * import the  Neccessary libraries
   * Remove the null values and check duplicate values
   * Drop the unwanted column in the dataset
   * I use median to impute into the missing values

 # After cleaning and preprocesssing i done a EDA for the dataset
 # Then i use random forest to predict the Machine learning model
 # And i use streamlit to Show the machine learning prediction
